Shared Notifications API 1.0.0
=============================

A plugin that creates an API which mimics the [ProBoards](https://www.proboards.com/) notifications system, but these notifications are shared amongst specified users that are entered in the settings.  This is useful if you want to send a notification to certain staff members.

The plugin uses 1 super forum key and will get auto pruned if it gets filled up.
